                        <p class="lead">Drunk walk is an seemingly arbitrary rhythm generator that desynchronizes the limbs.</p>
                        <p>Maybe you can identify with the title of the piece.... The piece is designed to put the performer in a rhythmically stressful environment. There is no repetition, nor is there any groove, meaning that the performer cannot form any expectations or familiarity to the rhythms that are generated by the engine. It is purely reactive, and it is a struggle, just like the not-so-elegant walk home from the bar after a night of heavy drinking.</p>
                        <p>To perform the piece, play when a black circle, called a <em>foot</em> enters the empty circle, called an <em>endzone</em>. The left lane indicates when you should play with your left limb, and the right lane indicates when you should play with your right limb. It is going to get difficult to play at times: discerning which <em>foot</em> is going to arrive at an <em>endzone</em> first, the speed at which a <em>foot</em> travels, and the number of <em>feet</em> that are in transit are all potential stressors that will vary in activity over the course of the piece. Remember to try your best, and staggering in confusion is exactly what a drunk walker would do.</p>
